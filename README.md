This repo contains a list of Socialbakers Engineering titles, roles, and associated responsibilities, also known as The Ladder.

> System is exception based, meaning that we don't assume that we have a people fitting all of points. Therefore, discussion about level is goal based, not proof based, e.g. "We see you at level 3, but for that we need you to be more active on a feature refinement meetings". We can also mark some trait as an exception in a meaning of "You are a great architect and we don't expect that you will speak publicly, even if it is described in the Ladder". 

| scope/level    | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| coding         |   0-1   |    1    |    2    |    3    |    4    |
| contribution   |   0-1   |   0-1   |   1-2   |   2-4   |   3-4   |
| leadership     |   0-1   |   0-1   |   0-2   |   1-3   |   2-4   |
| communication  |   0-1   |    1    |   1-2   |   2-3   |   3-4   |
| **min SUM**    |  **2**  |  **5**  |  **8**  |  **14** |  **20** |

Also, Ladder does not introduce a hierarchy. Responsibility for a delivering value is on the whole team and all levels of the developers are equal - the goal of ladder is establishing a road for career development, to set an expectations and give a points to disuss on regular 1-1 meetings.

> As a additional metric to the Ladder, we have a system of Perks, currently under the development. Badges will mark exceptional qualities not described in the Ladder, usually a technical abilities like deep knowledge of Elastic or being an ambassador of BDD aproach.
